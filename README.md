# Employee Tracker

## Description

This was a challenging project for me. I had a hard time setting up the structure of the project and connecting the files together. I ended up deleting and restarting multiple times trying to figure out the best way. I set this up to better learn how to create a useful CLI project that was able to keep track of all the departments, roles, and employees for a company. I wanted to be able to add departments, roles, employees, and update existing employees to keep up with a growing and changing business.
